In April 2016, I gave a short lecture to Computer Science students from my old college. I wanted to show them what GUI creation in Java (Swin) was like, compared to how they were doing it (and how I did it when I was at college). While the content was a bit baffling for them, as it was a bit fast pased, they got the key message, which was showing how much .NET (what the college uses) hides away from the user.

Within this repo are the lecture PowerPoint slides, in both *.pptx* and *.pdf*, as well as the Java project I used to describe LayoutManagers.

The project was created within Eclipse. To test this code out for yourself, clone this repo into a desired folder of yours. Then, import the repo into your Eclipse workspace, via *Import...*, then *General > Existing Projects into Workspace*. From there, you should be able to run the program like any other Eclipse project.

Additionally, you can import directly from the Git clone URI within Eclipse. Right clicking on your Eclipse Project Explorer, navigating to *Import...*, then navigating to *Git > Projects from Git*, you can follow the wizard to clone this project for your own perview.
